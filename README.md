## Description
 - A 3D simulation of two agents moving	through a static environment, created using Processing. 
 - The agents are represented by some spiders and their goal is to reach the flies (the red spider's target is the red fly and the yellow spider's goal is the yellow fly). They also need to avoid the raindrops in the grass, represented by blue spheres.
 -  We used the A Star technique for AI planning, which will find the ideal path between the spider and the fly. The nodes are not represented in the simulation for aesthetic reasons, but the edges between them are represented with white lines depicting the spider's web.
 
## User interaction
 - arrows: move the obstacle (dark blue raindrop)
 - space: pause/resume simulation
 - r: moves spiders to initial position
 - a, s, d, w: move the red spider
 - mouse: zoom in/out using the mouse

## Programming language
- Processing 

## Libraries 
 - peasy: PeasyCam provides a dead-simple mouse-driven camera for Processing.
